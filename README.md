#Greedy Library
Coefplot will plot the coefficients for 3 different model types. 
Coefvis will explain visually why a linear model gave a parameter a particular coefficient.
Greedy will run the forward selection of parameters.
Collinify will rename collinear parameters.
Greedyvis will track the forward selection using BIC and the coefficients.
